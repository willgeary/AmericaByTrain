# America By Train
Visualizing one week of Amtrak activity.

Full video available here:

Amtrak GTFS data was obtained in 2013 via a FOIA request. See here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/transit-developers/XcSiFD3uzuw

See the python notebook for the steps I took to wrangle the GTFS data into shape.

See the Processing file for the script to visualize the cleaned GTFS data.
